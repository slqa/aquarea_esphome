# aquarea_esphome

Project allows for contorol Aquarea F series heatpupms directly from HomeAssistant via standard EspHome controls
For functioning there is need for special hardware which you will have to put inbetween remote control and heatpump
Thanks to such device you are able to monitor heatpump states, and supply your own commands
